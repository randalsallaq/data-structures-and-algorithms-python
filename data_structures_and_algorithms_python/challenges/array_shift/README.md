# Arrays Shifting

shifting an array is to insert a new index to the array in a specific place; in the begenning or in the middle for instance.

# Challenge

add an index to the middle of the array


# Approach & Efficiency
 - we can do this by getting the array's length then the middle index by dividing it by 2
 - then we will copy the original array's values to a new one
 - after that we will append the new array the added value.
